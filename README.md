# Sign Edge

### Overview:
This is a project to create a machine learning method for classification of the type of street sign that is shown in a image. The method chosen will be to use transfer learning on a pre trained convolutional neural network by stripping off the last node and training a classification model on the features obtained.

### Business Understanding:
* ***TBD***

### The Data:
The proposed data to be used is the annotated LISA traffic sign dataset that can be found [here](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html). The data will need to be cleaned by way of picking out the signs to be trained on. A possible expansion to this project would be to use a image vision technique (e.g. OpenCV libraries) to pick the signs out of the image.

### Model:
* ***TBD***

### Outcome:
The first benchmark for a minimal viable product
